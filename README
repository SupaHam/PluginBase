PluginBase is a multi-module library designed with the intent of producing high quality, feature
rich Minecraft plugins with a minimal amount of time and effort.

PLEASE NOTE:  If you use any part of this plugin I highly recommend using the maven-shade-plugin
in order to RELOCATE your code to a new namespace.  MANY things change between release versions and
even snapshot versions.  This can cause conflicts if multiple plugins use this library without
relocation and are using different builds.

See the README file located in each module for more information about the modules.
