Features:
- Thread safe logging.
- Plugin name prepended to log messages.
- Debug messages append plugin name with -Debug or custom string.
- CONFIG messages can be silenced and print out as INFO when not.
- FINE, FINER, and FINEST show as INFO when debugging enabled while also being written to a debug.log file.
- Allows you to share debug logs with another plugin.  (How Multiverse does it..)
- Adds var-arg parameter logging methods for use with messages in the style of String.format().
- FINE, FINER, and FINEST messages do not perform String.format() on messages that won't be logged.

This logging library will hopefully be one of the more stable modules of PluginBase codewise.  However, it is
still recommended to make use of the maven shade plugin and relocate the code to your own namespace.
